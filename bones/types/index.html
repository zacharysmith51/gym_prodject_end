            <h2 onclick="alert('wip audio coming soon')">flat bones</h2>
            <!--add audio-->
            There are flat bones in the skull (occipital, parietal, frontal, nasal, lacrimal, and vomer),
             the thoracic cage (sternum and ribs), and the pelvis (ilium, ischium, and pubis).
              The function of flat bones is to protect internal organs such as the brain, heart,
               and pelvic organs. Flat bones are somewhat flattened, and can provide protection,
                like a shield; flat bones can also provide large areas of attachment for muscles.

        <div class="col">
            <h2 onclick="alert('wip audio coming soon')">short bones</h2>
            <!--add audio-->
            Short bones are about as long as they are wide. Located in the wrist and ankle joints, short bones provide stability and some movement. The carpals in the wrist (scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, hamate, pisiform, capitate, trapezoid, and trapezium) and the tarsals in the ankles (calcaneus, talus, navicular, cuboid, lateral cuneiform, intermediate cuneiform, and medial cuneiform) are examples of short bones.

        <div class="col">
            <h2 onclick="alert('wip audio coming soon')">long bones</h2>
            <!--add audio-->
            The long bones, longer than they are wide, include the femur (the longest bone in the body) as well as relatively small bones in the fingers. Long bones function to support the weight of the body and facilitate movement. Long bones are mostly located in the appendicular skeleton and include bones in the lower limbs (the tibia, fibula, femur, metatarsals, and phalanges) and bones in the upper limbs (the humerus, radius, ulna, metacarpals, and phalanges).

            <h2 onclick="alert('wip audio coming soon')">irregular bones</h2>
            <!--add audio-->
            Irregular bones vary in shape and structure and therefore do not fit into any other category (flat, short, long, or sesamoid). They often have a fairly complex shape, which helps protect internal organs. For example, the vertebrae, irregular bones of the vertebral column, protect the spinal cord. The irregular bones of the pelvis (pubis, ilium, and ischium) protect organs in the pelvic cavity.

        <div class="col">
            <h2 onclick="alert('wip audio coming soon')">sesamoid bones</h2>
            <!--add audio-->
            Sesamoid bones are bones embedded in tendons. These small, round bones are commonly found in the tendons of the hands, knees, and feet. Sesamoid bones function to protect tendons from stress and wear. The patella, commonly referred to as the kneecap, is an example of a sesamoid bone.
